Things that we need to do on pyAERIoe

* Test the appending ability
* Fix the output issue with single samples
* Using a temporal resolution other than 0 in VIP creates an error
* Output files are still too large; netCDF dimensions are (probably) correct but not storing either Sop or Akernal properly in a sample-by-sample way
